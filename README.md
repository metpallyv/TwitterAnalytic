# TwitterAnalytics using Twitter RestApis
The goal of this project is to be able to perform Twitter Analytics using the Twitter Rest APIs

The reason for this project is that I want to perform two things using Twitter tweets:

1. Sentiment Analysis of Tweets.

2. I wanted to estimate US Congressmen's stance on a particular political issue/bill. For example, 
   I want to capture Donald Trump's political ideology using his tweets and friends information on Twitter. 
   Furthermore, if we make use of the text information of users’ tweets, especially retweets, to better understand political       figure’s emphasis on different topics. If Donald Trump follows Hillary CLinton on Twitter and if he retweets lots of
   postive tweets of Hillary clinton related to Iran Nuke bill, we can predict that Donald Trump would vote postively for 
   that Iran Nuke bill.

#Twitter Analytics Crawler
This application crawls through each and every US congressmen's Twitter account and
    1. Returns the US congressmen followers for each US congressmen
    2. Tweets for each US congressmen
    3. Retweets for each US congressmen.
